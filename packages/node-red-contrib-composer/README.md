# node-red-contrib-hyperledger-composer
A set of nodes for interacting with Hyperledger Composer

## Hyperledger-Composer-Out
A node red output node that allows you to create, update or delete assets or participants and submit transactions.

### Example Usage
This example uses the Car Auction Sample Network that can be obtained from [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer-sample-networks/tree/master/packages/carauction-network)

The Car Auction Sample, simulates a car auction. It has two kinds of participant. An Auctioneer, who is responsible for conducting the auction, and a member who can bid on cars in the auction.
In this example we will create a participant, the participant .

1. Deploy the Car Auction Sample Network using the playground or on the command line (If you don't know how to do this go [here](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer))

2. Create a `hyperledger-composer-out node`

3. On `Composer Card` click the pencil top add a new config node. Specify the `card name`, or use the drop down to use one previous created.

4. Use an inject node and set it to use `JSON` and enter the following JSON

```
{"$class": "org.acme.vehicle.auction.Member",   "balance": 1234,   "email": "Joe-Blogs@org.acme.com",   "firstName": "Joe",   "lastName": "Blogs" }
```

5. Using the playground or command line you should now be able to see the participant that has been created.

## Hyperledger-Composer-Mid
A node red mid flow node that allows you to create, retrieve, update, or delete assets and participants from a registry.

### Example Usage
This example follows on from the above example. It will retrieve the participant that was created above.
 
 1. Create a `hyperledger-composer-mid node`

 2. On `Composer Card` click the pencil top add a new config node. Specify the `card name`, or use the drop down to use one previous created.
 
 3. Use an `inject node` and set it to use JSON and enter the following JSON
 
 ```
{"modelName" : "org.acme.vehicle.auction.Member", "id" : "Joe-Blogs@org.acme.com"}
```

4. Use a `debug node` to capture the output from the `hyperledger-composer-mid node`

## Hyperledger-Composer-In
A node red input node that subscribes to events from a blockchain

1. On `Composer Card` click the pencil top add a new config node. Specify the `card name`, or use the drop down to use one previous created.
